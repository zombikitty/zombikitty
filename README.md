BYI
! - Some of us have a hard time holding up a conversation, so please be aware of that ! we dont mean to offend anyone, were just really bad at interacting.!

! - Majority of us make kms/kys jokes, and we forget to use tonetags! please let us know if you need us to use them !

! - We get attached to people if we frequently talk, (sometimes!) ! we dont mean to, we promise !!

! - We get anxious / stressed really easily! pressuring us to do something will result in ghosting or a block ^_^
