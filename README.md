Boundaries!

- We sometimes make freaky jokes, it is never intended to harm anyone.

- We have attachment issues. It isnt too bad, but at a point it can.

- We make kys/kms jokes, and sometimes forget tonetags. if you are an idividual who needs tonetags, please let us know before-hand.

- Sometimes we might not remember you. that is because we are a different alter, possibly. If we dont remember, just give us a whisper to let us know.
